##### Talking Points

1. Can a prepaid phone number make calls from Verizon, but stay locked with T-Mobile, i.e., could not fully transfer number into Verizon prepaid. Outgoing calls, but no incoming texts. Further, texts were received from Verizon operator.

2. Building number 1618 at Marquette and building number 1617 at StrandX? Discovered after picking up Subaru Outback from towing. The building is tucked away behind Green Cab and the Towing Facility off of Park St. I drew a heart on the door, took that picture, then left.

3. When attempting to get fuel to leave, Kelly's Market which has been open for more than five years to my knowledge was closed. What's more is the crypto currency ATM was discovered by yours truly some time before that. I suspect the ATM is tied to the owners of Cash App. What's more is that I don't think anyone in Madison would have even considered it had I not said something. However, the only place you will find any mention of this ATM and Cash App is via WALL which is an old command line tool intended to communicate with another machine on your network. Please pay close attention to windows to which my cellular service was inactive, but still had internet on that laptop. You can prove this if my messages made it to their machine.

4. Is Howard Fuller a real person? If so, was he Cheryl Olp's boss? If not, why was Kevin Olp so excited to show me a video of some public discussion. Cheryl and Kevin are very Republican. Supposedly, Howard fuller is not, but why was he showing me a random video of him arguing a conservative talking point. If this offense to anyone, know that I was fed a news article that read Howard Fuller's name and how he hung himself somewhere in California. This was during the riots of the summer 20220. The article was discovered while I was at a Chicago AirBnb on W Cortland St. on Chicago's North side - maybe Logan Square. This is the same AirBnb that I got sick from the donut and also the place I was last before the Greyhound trip to New York in which I was stranded in Indianapolis. There should not be any internet traffic associated with my devices because my first day there, I submitted the credentials, but had to tell her it was not working.
